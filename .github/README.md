  Zerodya's Nix Config

  (WIP)
</h1>
</div>

This repository contains the NixOS configuration for my desktop and laptop

> This repo is costantly changing and evolving.\
I cannot guarantee that it will work on any machine but my own.\
You shouldn't blindly build this repo on your machine.

## Content
For simplicity, this config is structured in just 3 directories:
- 💾 **[system](/system)** ~ contains the NixOS system configuration
- 🏠 **[home](/home)** ~ contains my dotfiles and the Home-Manager user configuration
- 💻 **[hosts](/hosts)** ~ host-specific configurations; each host imports their own system and home modules from the directories above

You can find more info inside each repository.

## Screenshots
[Coming soon]
